	  Additionally, I don't think extern is needed on the declarations
	  of the functions in include/vpb/FileUtils. At least, everything
	  compiles and links correctly on Windows when they are removed...
	  It also compiled well when they where there, so if it causes a
	  problem on Linux then just leave them. "

	* Various updates to build properly.

2007-03-14 15:14 +0000 [r620]  robert:

	* Removed all osgTerrain classes, and merged changes: From Colin
	  McDonald, "I was getting crashes in
	  DataSet::SourceData::readImage if one of destHeight or destWidth
	  came out to be one. There was also an error with alpha blending
	  in that routine. Between osg versions 1.0 and 1.2 last year there
	  was a large increase in the size of many database files produced
	  by osgdem, of the order of x2 to x4. Some other people have
	  commented on it in osg-users, as with databases which were
	  already large it has caused some problems in transferring them to
	  customers. I have done some investigation into the Simplifier
	  changes during that period, and the principal cause appears to be
	  a change in the logic of
	  osgUtil::Simplifier::continueSimplificationImplementation.
	  Previously in osg v1.0 it always carried on simplifying while the
	  simplification error was less than getMaximumError(). But in osg
	  v1.2 it stops simplifying whenever the max error is exceeded OR
	  the target primitive ratio is reached. A simple adjustment to the
	  targetMaxNumVertices in DataSet::DestinationTile::createPolygonal
	  reduces the database sizes near to the osg v1.0 sizes."

2007-02-11 12:23 +0000 [r607]  robert:

	* Updated wrappers

2007-02-11 10:33 +0000 [r606]  robert:

	* From Vivek Rajan, new osgManipulator library, with a few minor
	  tweaks and rename for osgDragger to osgManipulator for build by
	  Robert Osfield. Vivek's email to osg-submissions: "I'm happy to
	  release the osgdragger nodekit to the OSG community. I
	  implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and
	  they have kindly agreed to open source it. The nodekit contains a
	  few draggers but it should be easy to build new draggers on top
	  of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a SIGGRAPH 2002
	  course - "Design and Implementation of Direct Manipulation in
	  3D". You can find the course notes at
	  http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29
	  of the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how
	  the nodekit works. The source code also contains an example of
	  how to use the draggers."

	* From Luigi Calori, "In order to effectively use --image-ext and
	  to add -O "plugin options", some fix to osgdem.cpp and
	  osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp These mods should allow to build terrains
	  controlling jpeg compressed imagery embedded in ive files, using
	  something like: osgdemd --image-ext jpeg --RGB_24 -O
	  "JPEG_QUALITY 20 compressImageData" ......."

2006-11-22 20:52 +0000 [r595]  robert:

	* From Paul de Repentigny, "When calling osgdem with argument
	  "--image-ext", the application just returns after loading the
	  proper ReaderWriter for the given extension." Fix was to remove
	  the erroenous return.

2006-11-14 12:55 +0000 [r594]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "I ran though the sample data that Gert
	  provided earlier today and tracked down the problem. The xoffset
	  in readHeightField and readImage were being applied even in
	  projected coordinate systems. This patch should fix the issue."

2006-11-03 14:07 +0000 [r593]  robert:

	  and DEM's to the destination graphs, once for the original
	  position, and once for the wrap around 360 degrees on or before.
	  Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the
	  _max to DBL_MIN rather than -DBL_MAX. This bug causesd the y axis
	  to be computed incorrectly.

2006-08-31 20:54 +0000 [r579]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers of the up comming 1.2 release

	  Solaris 8 and Aix

2006-07-31 20:56 +0000 [r573]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "I've attached fixes to DataSet that should
	  fix the problems that Maya was seeing yesterday. The issue was
	  that the new interpolation code I submitted didn't use the
	  SourceData's georef, it was assuming that the GDALDataSet had a
	  proper geo-ref. I've made the getInterpolatedValue method a
	  member of SourceData and now it uses the georef the SourceData's
	  georef. I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the
	  DataSet header."

2006-07-27 16:41 +0000 [r572]  robert:

	* From Jason Beverage, "This patch should fix Gert's problem that
	  he posted on osg-users. I downloaded the sample he posted,
	  reproduced the error, and added an additional check to make sure
	  the GDAL window size was valid. Now his example works fine.
	  Changes made against current CVS. "

2006-07-19 21:49 +0000 [r571]  robert:

	* Updated version for the release

2006-07-11 10:34 +0000 [r568]  robert:

	* From Antoine Hue, "There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()",
	  appear to be a getter => "int getNotifyOffset()". Then I have
	  added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when the current
	  notify level + local offset permit message display. In fact, if
	  the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default,
	  DataSet is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite
	  disturbing since you think the progress is related to the
	  complete processing but it is actually only related to the GDAL
	  Warp."

2006-07-06 10:28 +0000 [r567]  robert:

	* Updated version numbers for 1.1 release

2006-06-12 09:57 +0000 [r566]  robert:

	  which used doubles in place of the original usage of
	  osg::BoundingBox. Added path for computing interpolation
	  elevation data being read from GDAL.

2006-05-15 09:46 +0000 [r561]  robert:

	* From Carlos García and Paul Baker, Port of Paul Baker's Quake3
	  BSP loader to OSG by Carlos García. Added Quake3 BSP plugin.

2006-05-02 09:45 +0000 [r560]  robert:

	* Reorganised the Group::removeChild and Geode::removeDrawable
	  methods so that removeChild(Node*), removeChild(uint) and
	  equivilant Geode methods are now inline methods, not designed to
	  be overriden, and seperated out the multiple remove method to be
	  called removeChildren(uint, uint) which is now the only virtual
	  method. There removeChildren is now the method to override in
	  subclasses. This reorganisation requires some call code to be
	  rename removeChild usage to removeChildren.

2006-05-01 14:51 +0000 [r559]  robert:

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "when building debug libs in mingw the
	  .dll.a files are not copied to the lib/MINGW(32) folder. The
	  makefiles in the attached zip should fix this."

2006-02-06 19:41 +0000 [r553]  don:

2005-06-24 15:39 +0000 [r505]  robert:

	* From Colin McDonald: "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris: For
	  multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified on
	  both the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.
	  According to the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT
	  flags in the system header files, and links the -lthread library
	  in the correct order. When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC
	  option should be specified. Although Solaris will handle shared
	  libraries without position-independent code there is a
	  performance penalty. The linker reference manual says: 'If a
	  shared object is built from code that is not
	  position-independent, the text segment will usually require a
	  large number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although
	  the runtime linker is equipped to handle this, the system
	  overhead this creates can cause serious performance
	  degradation'."

2005-06-24 15:15 +0000 [r504]  robert:

2002-09-24 20:14 +0000 [r131]  robert:

	* Changed the linux linking of -lgif to -lungif. Fixed a typo in
	  the Images name.

2002-09-24 20:04 +0000 [r130]  robert:

	* Changed the image file so that use the Images/ prefix to help
	  locate the files within the OpenSceneGraph-Data directory.

2002-09-05 15:13 +0000 [r129]  don:

	* For Solaris, /usr/local/lib dependencies now compile static
	  libraries. This reduces the dependencies for binary installs.
	  ALso rearranged the SunOS gnu and Forte compiler sections to be
	  more generic

2002-08-31 06:04 +0000 [r128]  don:

	* Added the script to make IRIX distribution packages (via 'inst').

2002-08-30 16:17 +0000 [r127]  robert:

	* Updates to windows build docs. Merge fixes for OSX from bob.
	  Added checking for impostor sprites into stats.

2002-08-30 07:17 +0000 [r126]  robert:

	  avoid issues with the missing <sstream>

2002-08-28 16:17 +0000 [r125]  robert:

	* Added fixes to UnitTestFramework to get it compiling under
	  Windows.

2002-08-28 14:26 +0000 [r124]  robert:

	* Added Neil Salter's osgUtx library into the distribution, have
	  put all the orignal seperate headers and source into
	  include/osg/UnitTestFrameWork and src/osg/UnitTestFramework.cpp
	  respectively. I have done this to keep the include and source
	  directories focused on the scene graph rather than the test
	  framework. Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which
	  are optionally compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS
	  define, which is only currently defined in debug builds under
	  unix. It should be fine to add it in under Windows project files
	  as well. Finally, a new demo app osgunittests runs the tests and
	  reports success or failure of the tests.

2002-08-27 14:02 +0000 [r123]  robert:

	* Added proper osgtexture1D demo - this demo uses a 1D texture to
	  dynamically contour the scene.

2002-08-27 10:06 +0000 [r122]  robert:

	* Added osgtexture3D demo, renamed osgtexture demo to osgtexture2D,
	  and have added osgtexture1D demo which currently is simply copy
	  of osgtexture2D. I will be modifying it to do 1D texturing next.
	  Fixed a bug in osg::Texture3D relating to checking of existance
	  of texturing. Merged some fixes to the pfb loader from Ulrich
	  Hertlein.

2002-08-22 17:36 +0000 [r121]  don:

	* Fixed a dependency order

2002-08-20 11:27 +0000 [r120]  robert:

	* Moved the IO support for the osgText and osgParticle libraries
	  into seperate plugin libraries.

2002-08-13 18:29 +0000 [r119]  don:

	* Added some comments

2002-08-09 16:27 +0000 [r118]  robert:

	* Fixed the X and Y axis rotation billboards so that now rotate
	  correctly. Rewrote the osgbillboard demo so that it creates a
	  point rotatated billbaord and X,Y and Z axis billboards to both
	  test and demonstrate this types of billboards in action.

2002-08-03 18:11 +0000 [r117]  robert:

	* Integrated Ulrich Hertlien's osg::Sequence node, and osgsequence
	  demo, and support for osg::Sequence in the pfb loader.

2002-07-26 15:37 +0000 [r116]  robert:

	* Added Ruben Lopez's Inventor/VRML 1.0 loader.

2002-07-25 14:42 +0000 [r115]  robert:

	* Removed double quotes from around the : DBGF = -g
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMORY_MANAGER As this was breaking the build.

2002-07-23 15:01 +0000 [r114]  robert:

	* Mods for HP-UX port.

2002-07-23 13:30 +0000 [r113]  robert:

	* Support added for Gnu C++ under Solaris.

2002-07-23 10:48 +0000 [r112]  robert:

	* Checked in Tino Schwarze's port to HP-UX.

2002-07-20 16:24 +0000 [r111]  don:

	* Added logo plugin

2002-07-19 12:51 +0000 [r110]  robert:

	* Removed the cow.osg paramter for the osgparticle cow.osg in the
	  test scripts

2002-07-18 22:34 +0000 [r109]  robert:

	* Added osgoccluder to test scripts.

2002-07-18 10:49 +0000 [r108]  robert:

	* Updated the test scripts to include cube mapping example and
	  osglight demo.

2002-07-16 19:21 +0000 [r107]  robert:

	* Updates from Bob Kuehne and Kristopher Bixler to remove the fink
	  dependency from the MacOSX build.

2002-07-16 15:13 +0000 [r106]  robert:

	* Fixes for MacOSX build from Bob Kuehne.

2002-07-15 13:20 +0000 [r105]  robert:

	* Fixed the orientation of the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection plane is orientated towards the viewer. Changed the
	  lightmodel ambient level to 0.1,0.1,0.1 instead of 0.0, so that a
	  small amount of ambient lighting is available to render back
	  surfaces. The osgreflect and osgprerender suffered unexpected
	  behaviors because of no lighting on the backfaces.

2002-07-15 11:44 +0000 [r104]  robert:

	* Fixed memory leak in FieldReaderIterator.cpp. Updated the
	  Make/osgtests.bat and Make/debugtests.bat scripts.

2002-07-15 10:53 +0000 [r103]  robert:

	* Renamed hangglide to osghangglide

2002-07-11 23:30 +0000 [r102]  don:

	* added -lpthread to the link line for Linux builds. Seems Red Hat
	  7.3 turns up undefined symbols without it.

2002-07-11 16:12 +0000 [r101]  robert:

	* Added support for multitexturing to osg::State and added
	  osgmultitexture demo which adds as spherical environment map
	  using texture 1 to any model.

2002-07-10 13:33 +0000 [r100]  robert:

	* Updates to osgprerender to support use of rendering to an image,
	  rather then just a texture.

2002-07-09 13:17 +0000 [r99]  robert:

	* Added new demo osgprerender to demonstrate how to prerender a
	  scene and use the result in the main rendering for special
	  effects.

2002-07-04 14:23 +0000 [r98]  robert:

	* Added osgGA to the MIGNW makedefs.

2002-07-02 15:01 +0000 [r97]  don:

	* -n32 and -64 entries were reversed in makedefs

2002-07-01 14:40 +0000 [r96]  don:

	* More 64 bit build specifics in IRIX makedefs file

2002-07-01 14:20 +0000 [r95]  don:

	* Removed -ldl from makedefs for IRIX

2002-06-21 16:45 +0000 [r94]  robert:

	* Added new osggeometry demo to test the work on the new
	  osg::Geometry Drawable.

2002-06-15 20:57 +0000 [r93]  robert:

	* Fixes for Visual .NET and Mingw builds, and fix MacOSX notify()
	  crash.

2002-06-13 16:21 +0000 [r92]  robert:

	* Further work on Occlusion Culling. Most of work is complete, just
	  debugging required now.

2002-06-12 14:57 +0000 [r91]  robert:

	* Changes for MacOSX build, send in by Bob Kuehne.

2002-06-09 13:10 +0000 [r90]  robert:

	* Checked in migration from osgUtil based GUIAdapter code to Neil
	  Salter's osgGA (Gui Abstraction). This may break users code, but
	  all it should require to fix the builds should be a change from
	  osgUtil::CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA::CameraManipulator and
	  include <osgUtil/CameraManipulator (etc) to
	  osgGA/CameraManipulator and the extra dependency of the link
	  line.

2002-06-08 19:58 +0000 [r89]  robert:

	* More more occlusion culling.

2002-06-05 12:44 +0000 [r88]  robert:

	* Checked in osgParticle, writtten by Marco Jez.

2002-05-28 23:43 +0000 [r87]  robert:

	* Added new osgcallback demo, and updated small API changes to
	  improve the flexiblity of callbacks. Added beginings of convex
	  planer occlusions culling.

2002-05-21 00:58 +0000 [r86]  don:

	* Modified instrules so that the functionality of instlinks is that
	  system links are not made to point to links, rather the real
	  files. So links installed on a system are pointing to platform
	  specific files rather than links that may be pointing to files of
	  the wrong platform type.

2002-05-10 19:30 +0000 [r85]  robert:

	* Added image plugin library defs for IRIX, submission from Randall
	  Hopper.

2002-05-09 10:31 +0000 [r84]  robert:

	* Added new osgGA - GUI Adapter library submitted by Neil Salter.
	  This will replace the current GUI adapter code inside osgUtil.

2002-05-07 02:51 +0000 [r83]  don:

	* Fixed rpath nonsense in makedefs for Irix

2002-05-03 16:47 +0000 [r82]  robert:

	* Added support for the managing the StateSet above a LightSource
	  node, and made it an osg::Group so that it can be used a
	  decorator above a scene. Added osgclip demo to the test suite.

2002-05-02 00:14 +0000 [r81]  robert:

	* dded osg::ClipNode class for managing OpenGL clipping planes, and
	  osgclip demo.

2002-04-25 22:09 +0000 [r80]  robert:

	* Fixes for IRIX build. Fix for a warning under VisualStudio.NET.

2002-04-25 10:46 +0000 [r79]  robert:

	* A more verbose version of the test script, using each and more
	  memleaks.log to print out progress and report any memory leaks
	  which have been logged. The later will only occur with a debug
	  build. The use of echo and more makes this version osgtest.bat
	  not portable to windows unfortuntately.

2002-04-24 20:04 +0000 [r78]  robert:

	* Changes for Mac OSX build, sent in by Bob Kuehne

2002-04-24 08:50 +0000 [r77]  robert:

	* Fix for the Cygwin build related to the new FileUtils_Unix not
	  using the Windows PATH environmental variable for searching for
	  libraries. Sent in by Norman Vine. Reoder of the
	  makedefs/makedirdefs to fix Mac OSX compilation. Sent in by Bob
	  Kuehne.

2002-04-22 09:50 +0000 [r76]  robert:

	* Added test script which runs all the demos in the OSG to make
	  sure they run ok. User has to verify they are correct visually.

2002-04-18 15:37 +0000 [r75]  don:

	* changed LIBEXT to LIB_EXT for Darwin

2002-04-18 15:16 +0000 [r74]  don:

	* Added -lXi to the Linux X_LIBS

2002-04-16 21:39 +0000 [r73]  don:

	* Changed Linux makedepend flag from -MM to -M

2002-04-16 15:21 +0000 [r72]  don:

	* Added makedirdefs via a request from Bob Kheune. This allows us
	  to edit the DIRS cruft in a single file in the Make directory
	  instead of having to edit multiple files. Also edited Makefiles
	  that needed to include this file. Also cleaned up txp loader to
	  compile with SunOS. This needs to be retested on other platforms.

2002-04-16 05:29 +0000 [r71]  don:

	* Fixed some boo-boos in makerpms for building demo source files...

2002-04-16 04:13 +0000 [r70]  don:

	* Fixed Solaris 'make distribution' for demo source.

2002-04-16 03:24 +0000 [r69]  don:

	* fixed a few problems that didn't work right with installing demo
	  source on platforms other than Solaris.

2002-04-15 21:48 +0000 [r68]  robert:

	* Compile fixes for IRIX, submitted by Randall Hopper.

2002-04-15 14:45 +0000 [r67]  don:

	* Added Daniel Sjölie's request to use a default complier (CXX) in
	  makedefs. Doing this only for Linux

2002-04-12 06:18 +0000 [r66]  don:

	* Solaris PKG distribution now makes a shar (self-extracting shell
	  archived) changed makepgk to do this. Changed another one of
	  those pesky cout = std::cout in CullVisitor.cpp

2002-04-12 05:09 +0000 [r65]  don:

	* added 'make cleandepend' to build system.

2002-04-12 05:06 +0000 [r64]  don:

	* Added the 'make cleandepend' target to the build system.

2002-04-10 21:51 +0000 [r63]  robert:

	* Added new osg::DrawPixels class with encapsulates glDrawPixels as
	  and osg::Drawable. Added osg::Image::readPixels to osg::Image.
	  Made osg::LightSource to default to cullActive set to false to
	  that LightSource nodes don't get culled by default.

2002-04-10 01:29 +0000 [r62]  don:

	* Added (previously omitted) libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libgif to
	  makedefs in the Linux section

2002-04-09 22:54 +0000 [r61]  don:

	* Fixed makedepend to do the right thing.

2002-04-09 15:51 +0000 [r60]  don:

	* Checking in all Makefile.inst in src/Demos/*. These are the
	  Makefiles that get installed rather than the build Makefiles.

2002-04-09 14:55 +0000 [r59]  don:

	* Added pkgadd distribution for Solaris. Added a cleaner way to
	  install demo source so that installed versions use a simplified
	  makedefs/makerules. Small fix to get osgText to compile with
	  Solaris CC. Constructor declared with a non-const argument, but
	  implemented with const argument.

2002-04-08 16:50 +0000 [r58]  don:

	* Added -lstdc++ to begining of LIBS on link line.. ??

2002-04-08 16:25 +0000 [r57]  don:

	* Put quotes around "DBGF" for multi argument

2002-04-07 17:47 +0000 [r56]  don:

	* Added a stop gap fix for cygwin build. Previous experiements were
	  creating library and plugin files that looked like system library
	  and system files which would have deleted original files on a
	  'make install'. Cygwin is not tested yet, but this needed to get
	  fixed before a cygwin user wiped out his system library files.

2002-04-05 01:52 +0000 [r55]  don:

	* Edited INSTALL for new make and installation procedures. Checking
	  in a fix for Norman Vine Added helprules and help.sh for a
	  long-winded help message if you 'make help'.

2002-04-04 18:01 +0000 [r54]  don:

	* Added Norman Vine's changes for CYGWIN builds Added distrules and
	  makerpms for building RPM distributions Removed old RedHatRPM
	  distribution build directory Added new dist/RPM directory and
	  placed temporary .spec files (these are generated by
	  Make/makerpms and are not intended for stand-alone use, but they
	  keep the directory warm and CVS happy)

2002-04-03 17:53 +0000 [r53]  don:

	* Cleaned up in stallation directives

2002-04-03 17:42 +0000 [r52]  don:

	* Reinstated Norman Vine's TARGET_BASENAME variable in the
	  makefiles and added prefixes and suffixes to libs and plugins.
	  ALl this to accomodate cygwin... Also added INST_SYS_PREFIX and
	  INST_SHARE_PREFIX for installation, as well as "standardizing"
	  the install locations for the various platforms.

2002-04-02 06:58 +0000 [r51]  don:

	* Oops forgot to add makedefs and makerules

2002-04-02 06:44 +0000 [r50]  don:

	* The new order for building OSG. All Makefiles are replaced and
	  the Make directory is left with four files only : makedefs
	  makerules makedirrules instrules These work for all platforms
	  supported so far, which include : Linux Irix Solaris MacOSX
	  Cygwin FreeBSD

2002-04-02 06:27 +0000 [r49]  don:

	* Folded in Bob Kuehne's changes for Mac OSX to makedefs and
	  makerules

2002-04-01 15:37 +0000 [r48]  don:

	* Added cleanlite rules to makerules.new

2002-04-01 04:54 +0000 [r47]  don:

	* *** empty log message ***

2002-04-01 03:39 +0000 [r46]  don:

	* Completed and tested instrules.new

2002-03-31 16:43 +0000 [r45]  don:

	* Added more to instrules and makedefs.new Folded in Randall
	  Hopper's changes for FreeBSD

2002-03-31 16:40 +0000 [r44]  robert:

	* Added new osg::Projection node, and osgUtil::NewCullVisitor which
	  are work in progress for the new support for controlling the
	  projection matrix from within the scene graph. Also Added
	  osg::State::getClippingVolume(), getProjectionMatrix() and
	  getModelViewMatrix() with allows drawables to access the current
	  projection, and model view matrices and the view frustum in local
	  coords to the drawable.

2002-03-29 06:54 +0000 [r43]  don:

	* Added new install rules for makefiles and updated makedefs and
	  makerules... more to come

2002-03-28 07:29 +0000 [r42]  don:

	* Couple a fixes in makedefs and makerules

2002-03-28 06:35 +0000 [r41]  don:

	* Added Norman Vines fixeds for cygwin

2002-03-27 16:31 +0000 [r40]  robert:

	* Futher updates to MemoryManager, fixed memory leak in osgconv.

2002-03-27 06:09 +0000 [r39]  don:

	* Update to makeefs/makerules

2002-03-27 00:55 +0000 [r38]  don:

	* update to makedefs.new makerules.new

2002-03-26 23:52 +0000 [r37]  robert:

	* Added support for osg::MemoryManager which is based upon Paul
	  Nettle's memory manager published at flipcode.com. This can be
	  turned on with the OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANGER option which then uses
	  custom global new and delete operators as well as provide osgNew
	  and osgDelete macro's which add ability to log line and file from
	  which calls are made. Updated osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgText and
	  osgPlugins/osg to use osgNew/osgDelete, and fixed memory leaks
	  highlighted by the new memory manager.

2002-03-26 21:26 +0000 [r35-36]  don:

	* Adding makedirrrules to Make directory

	* Temporarily adding makedefs.new and makerules.new to keep them
	  separate from current makedefs/makerules files. Will eventually
	  remove all makedefs.* and makerules.* and replace only makedefs
	  and makerules with makedefs.new and makedefs.new

2002-03-25 23:18 +0000 [r34]  robert:

	* Added osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's
	  memory manager published at flipcode. I havn't adopted Paul's
	  macro's for new/delete etc, but use osg prefixed versions instead
	  to allow greater flexiblity in handling include ordering. Have
	  fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a
	  result. To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line. Have yet to move
	  the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this next.

2002-02-13 22:56 +0000 [r33]  robert:

	* Updated the makefiles to all have the #!gmake reference to force
	  IRIX compilation using gmake rather than pmake or smake. This
	  gets round issues with exporting OSGHOME.

2002-02-12 23:49 +0000 [r32]  robert:

	* Added a set of test runs to the makefiles and demos. The demos
	  now have titles relevenat to their function.

2002-02-11 19:51 +0000 [r31]  robert:

	* Cleand up the root Makefile. Moved
	  CullVisitor/RenderStage/RenderStageLighting across to managing
	  lights entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the
	  management of modelview matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores
	  the absolute modelview matrix, rather than a model matrix as done
	  previously. The later allows RenderLeaf's to do a glLoadMatrix
	  rather than a glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.

2002-02-10 11:17 +0000 [r30]  robert:

	* Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-02-09 10:24 +0000 [r29]  robert:

	* Fixes for cygwin and mingw builds.

2002-02-08 22:55 +0000 [r28]  robert:

	* Added support for parents to Drawables. Bumped up version numbers
	  in prep for 0.8.44.

2002-02-08 09:30 +0000 [r27]  robert:

	* Fixes for IRIX and Boris Bralo's TerraPage loader.

2002-01-29 14:04 +0000 [r26]  robert:

	* Moved all references to osg::Cloner to osg::CopyOp.

2002-01-29 12:52 +0000 [r25]  robert:

	* Have add new osg::CopyOp which replaces last nights osg::Cloner,
	  the new class now combines Cloner and DeepCopy into one class.
	  Cloner and DeepCopy will be removed in next commit. Also have
	  added osgcopy app to Demos which shows how the CopyOp have be
	  subclassed to create users own specific handling of copying. Have
	  fixed copy constructor problems in GeoSet which fix the deep copy
	  problem experienced yesterday.

2002-01-16 12:29 +0000 [r24]  robert:

	* Submission from Sean Spicer which adds Make/makedefs.irix.std.64
	  which compiles the OSG as 64bit. Small changes by Robert to
	  accomodate recent MacOSX makefile changes.

2002-01-16 12:08 +0000 [r23]  robert:

	* Changes to Make/makerules.* and Make/makedefs.* to accomodate
	  MacOSX's need to treat plugins and shared libraries seperately.

2002-01-16 10:36 +0000 [r22]  robert:

	* First batch of changes required for MacOS X build. Orignal
	  submission from Phil Atkin, merged by Robert Osfield.

2002-01-04 20:44 +0000 [r21]  robert:

	* Renamed the TOP variable in the Makefiles to OSGHOME.
